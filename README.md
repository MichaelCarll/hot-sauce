# hot-sauce
Repo for my hotsauce website
This is a side project for a hot sauce website
I personally really love hot sauce and have been cooking my own so I figured why not create a hot sauce website with my developing code skills.
overtime I would like this website to look and feel like a real website until I believe it is ready to publish.
Until then, this can be used as a progression through my knowledge as a web dev and for employers to view on my Github account, Happy coding.
